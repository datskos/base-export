## Block exporter

Goal: in Nov 2023 we wanted to spin up an `op-reth` node for base-mainnet.
The only problem was syncing the node from genesis was going to take a significant amount of time.

Since we already had a synced `op-geth` node we wrote a tool to export blocks in RLP-encoded format
and then import them into `op-reth`

### Usage

```
cargo build --release
mkdir data
```

To export blocks 100k at a time, you can create an `export.sh` script like below to export up to block 13.2M (adjust as
needed). You will of course need an already synced node.

```shell
## export.sh
set -e
set -x
for ((i=1; i<=13200000; i+=100000)); do
    start=$i
    end=$((i + 99999))
    echo "Exporting" $start " - " $end
    ./target/release/base-export blocks -r '<BASE_RPC>' -p data/blocks_$end --start $start --end $end
done
```

Due to regression in the reth alpha.22 import pipeline that broke base imports, I've included a patch that you can
apply.

```shell
## in the reth repo, assuming you've made it a sibling to base-export/
git checkout v0.1.0-alpha.22
git apply ../base-export/alpha.22-import.patch

cargo build --release --features=optimism --bin=op-reth
```

A patch for reth beta.5 is also available via:

```shell
## in the reth repo, assuming you've made it a sibling to base-export/
git checkout v0.2.0-beta.5
git apply ../base-export/beta.5-import.patch

cargo build --release --features=optimism --bin=op-reth
```

To import into a fresh `op-reth` this is how I did it (you'll need to clone `reth` and build `op-reth`)

```shell
## import.sh (in your reth directory, compiled as op-reth)
## change datadir and adjust block number as needed
set -e
set -x
for ((i=1; i<=13200000; i+=100000)); do
    start=$i
    end=$((i + 99999))
    echo "Importing" $start " - " $end
    ./target/release/op-reth import --chain base --datadir <your_specified_data_dir> ../base-export/data/blocks_$end
done
```
